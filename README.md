To train and deploy your own model:

Run final.py on your PC to begin training the neural network.

It will generate a trained model file named trained_module.pth.

Transfer trained_module.pth to your robot's Raspberry Pi (or equivalent setup).

On the robot, load the model in your control script to begin real-time image-based navigation.

Feel free to use as many epochs as you'd likeâ€”longer training can improve accuracy!

Make sure your dataset is properly labeled with directional arrows, and adjust the number of classes in the script if needed.
